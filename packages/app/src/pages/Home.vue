                <h3>Notable Facts About DeFi</h3>
                <p>
                  1. DeFi is an umbrella term for financial services that run on
                  public blockchains. There are DeFi applications that enable
                  you to earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade
                  derivatives, trade assets, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  2. DeFi is a vertical within the crypto asset ecosystem that
                  has achieved stellar growth over the last two years generating
                  a broad and fast growing user base. Just like cryptocurrency,
                  DeFi is global, peer-to-peer (meaning directly between two
                  people, not routed through a centralized system),
                  pseudonymous, and open to all.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <div class="user-roles-right-main">
                <p>
                  3. Defi is faster than traditional banking. Through automation
                  built into the technology of DeFi (and it's core technology of
                  Blockchain) via the use of 'Smart Contracts'. By turning real
                  world contracts into code, all that is necessary to compete
                  and execute on a loan for example, is to fulfill pre-written
                  requirements online. No notaries, smaller legal teams, and
                  less waiting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  4. Through the use of DeFi technology many traditional models
                  and methods of investment can be replicated and improved upon
                  with the foundation of blockchain and access to
                  cryptocurrency.

                Currently many fundamental financial and investment systems are
                being reinvisioned by the advent of Cryptocurrency, Blockchain
                and more contemporarily, DeFi technologies. While this should be
                seen as an opportunity, investors must also be aware of the
                implications of being late to adopt these technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                As more and more systems are being disrupted by this technology
                daily, more and more major institutions are integrating,
                adapting, and adjusting to these lightning fast developments.

                <p>
                  Investing is a long term investment strategy on CreditCapital
                  that yields continual rewards of the CAPL token. CAPL will
                  accrue value as the platform grows and is adopted giving
                  investors an advantage in the long term while helping the
                  system.

                  Investor also invest into the system with CAPL but are
                  directly investing into the liquidity of the CreditCapital
                  platform via a long term bond. The incentive for bonding is
                  that those who choose to do so get to purchase CAPL at a
                  standardized discount rate based on the time they purchased
                  the bond versus the risk assessed value of the token.

                  Staking is the passive, long-term strategy of CreditCapital.
                  Stake your USDC-CAPL Liquidity Pool tokens to earn a regular
                  income.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Stakers earn CAPL passively when they stake their Liquidity
                  Pool tokens from CreditCapital operated Liquidity Pools. When
                  providing liquidity, users can stake their LP tokens into the
                  rewards vault and receive participation rewards in the form of
                  CAPL tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The amount of rewards a Staker receives is determined by the

                <p>
                  Borrowing is an active investment strategy for users seeking
                  to leverage their position. Using the borrowed CCUSD allows
                  users to either de-risk their position, or further invest into
                  other CreditCapital pools such as the CCUSD liquidity pool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Borrowers gain the ability to collateralize their tokens to
                  obtain a loan of CCUSD stable tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They can use this additional personal liquidity to grow their
                  portfolio via trading or in other real world applications.
                  This gives borrowers additional liquidity
                </p>

                  This collateral is locked up until the repayment of the stable
                  token loan. In the event of loss of portfolio liquidity or
                  failure to repay the loan and interest payments, the protocol
                  will liquidate the user’s position before it becomes
                  insolvent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  More collateral options will be made available in the future
                  based on partnerships with prominent lending organizations.

                  Introducing CCUSD, the Credit Capital USD-pegged Stable Token.
                  Any user holding a position on the platform may lock it in
                  order to borrow against a portion of its value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This allows users to borrow against their position as a form
                  of leverage or margin. CCUSD loans are always
                  over-collateralized, using the Liquidity Pools and external
                  price oracles to ensure that every CCUSD loan remains solvent.

                    Stablecoins/stable tokens are cryptocurrencies, the price of
                    which is pegged to another asset such as the US dollar, gold
                    or other cryptocurrencies.

                  <li>
                    The CCUSD stable token will be pegged to the US Dollar as a
                    collateralized stablecoin and will achieve stability by
                    being fully collateralized by assets and rewarding
                    appropriate balance of liquidity pools.

                      The Treasury Fund is a pool which allows users to purchase
                      shares which are staked-by-default. These shares entitle
                      the user to a proportionate claim on the value managed by
                      the Treasury, as well as regular revenue payments as a
                      result of the profit generated by the fund.

                    <p>
                      Tokens held by the fund may be invested into various

                      Credit Capital operates multiple Liquidity Pool (LP)
                      contracts which operate as Automated Market Makers,
                      allowing users to enter or exit the platform with ease,
                      and without needing to maintain an order book. Liquidity
                      Pools charge a very low fee (typically 0.3%) for all
                      transactions passing through them, resulting in a low
                      friction method of exchanging value. While primarily used
                      as a way to exchange different currencies, users are also
                      able to contribute to the liquidity of any pool, and in
                      doing so are rewarded with both a portion of the fees
                      generated by that pool, as well as bonus CAPL rewards.
