# Minting an NFT for Collateral Purposes
Say, for example, a user wants to store their investment property as collateral on The Protocol. They would have fields on a fillable form for details about the property. That data would get stored in an off-chain database, and the dapp would make call the contract, to mint the NFT. Then it would associate the database entry of the property, with the NFT's ID.
