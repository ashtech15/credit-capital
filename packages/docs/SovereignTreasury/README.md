# Outline of Treasury

The purpose of the treasury is to:
1. Act as a vault for interest payments from borrowers, and
2. To act as on onramp for revenue from property NFTs and DEX yield aggregation. The treasury recieves a portion of the interest paid by users (some part of the 3%).

Users can "buy into" of the treasury by buying tokens, kinda like buying a share of a company/co-op.
AUM (assets under management) There are funds being borrowed out of the treasury.

There's an upgradeable logic contract, that allows a quorum of parties to replace parts of the system, as needed.
