# Paying Back a Loan
Whenever a user wants, they can pay off their loan in order to unlock their collateral. There are two options:
1. Paying off the loan fully, and
2. Paying off a portion of the loan.

A user can go through the steps of paying back the loan using only the DApp and their wallet. The loan must be paid back in CCUSD tokens. This page in the DApp also shows the user their current balance and interest rate.
