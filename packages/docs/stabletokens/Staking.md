# Staking

Users can stake their CCUSD in "stability pools", with no minimum or maximum time lock. They will earn rewards from staking in these pools, fueled by the interest being charged on loans. The purpose of these pools is to lighten the load of CCUSD's primary stability mechanisms, by reducing the sell-pressure on the CCUSD market. Reward rates are based on the amount of revenue entering the pool and the amount of CCUSD staked in the pool.
