# Liquidation of Loans

This is also called revenue-redirecting on a loan. If the value of the real estate asset(s) backing the loan drop low enough to make the loan risky, a third party can interact with the dapp to initiate a “liquidation”.
Through the use of an oracle capable of estimating value, the platform will assign loans one of the following risk statuses:

Safe - 60% LTV

Risky - revenue redirection - 85% LTV

Pending/Insolvent - liquidation - 95%+ LTV
