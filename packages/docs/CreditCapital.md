# CreditCapital
Credit Capital will offer a stabletoken in the form of CCUSD. It will be loaned out by a smart contract, running on the Fantom proof-of-stake blockchain, and backed by either commercial real-estate/bonds in the traditional market or whitelisted crypto assets such as Liquidity Pool Positions.

The aim of the protocol is to enable users to mint stabletokens, which are backed by an asset basket that includes real estate.

The minting process will look like a loan being extended to the user, but the tokens will be minted at the time of loan initiation, to be destroyed upon being "returned" to the contract that minted them. The loan contract will utilize NFTs, representing commercial real estate, as collateral for a loan.
