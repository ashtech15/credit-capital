## CreditCapital Database Backend

### The Database backend exists to provide historic price data about the movement of CAPL. This service runs in order to pull up to date price data from the chain and store it in a centralized database. This data is then made available to the web3 DApp in order to accurately calculate daily/weekly/monthly price movements of CAPL as well as user's positions.
